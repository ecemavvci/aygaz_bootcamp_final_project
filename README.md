# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This Python script implements a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game where you can play against the computer. The game is played in rounds, and the player who wins two rounds first wins the game.

## Game Rules

1. **How to Play:**
   - In Rock, Paper, Scissors, two players (one human, one computer) face each other.
   - Each player takes turns choosing rock, paper, or scissors.
   - Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.

2. **Game Rounds:**
   - The game will be played for a minimum of 3 rounds.
   - In each round, a player can win, the computer can win, or it can be a draw.
   - In case of a draw, the score will not change, and a new round will be played.
   - The game is won by the player who wins two rounds.

3. **After the Game:**
   - After determining the winner, both players will be asked if they want to play again.
   - If both players agree, the game will restart.
   - If either player declines, the game will end.
